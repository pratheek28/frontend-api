# Frontend + API Integration Starter Code

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd frontend-app
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the React app:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Your app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tasks

- **Customize the Welcome Component**: Add your own message and additional HTML elements (like an image or list).
- **API Customization**: Replace the current API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`) with a different one, such as the [Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/) or [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/).
- **Deployment**: Deploy your project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and submit the GitHub repository link and deployment link.

## Submission

- Push your code to GitHub using the following commands:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed frontend app with API integration"
    git push origin main
    ```

- Submit your GitHub Classroom assignment, ensuring that you include both the repository and live deployment links.

- Was unable to deploy it on vercel, because of an error that said:
"Failed to compile.
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './index.css' in '/vercel/path0/src'
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1"
I went to the office hours and Nishant tried helping me, but was unsuccessful. He told me just submit what I have on github and write this message.
