# Frontend + API Integration Starter Code

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the React app:

## Tasks

- **Customize the Welcome Component**: Add your own message and additional HTML elements (like an image or list).
- **API Customization**: Replace the current API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`) with a different one, such as the [Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/) or [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/).
- **Deployment**: Deploy your project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and submit the GitHub repository link and deployment link.

## Submission

- Push your code to GitHub using the following commands:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed frontend app with API integration"
    git push origin main
    ```

- Submit your GitHub Classroom assignment, ensuring that you include both the repository and live deployment links.
